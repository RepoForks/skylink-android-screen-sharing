# skylink-android-screen-sharing

## Deprecation warning
This demo uses a past version of Skylink SDK for Android, which is no longer the best version to use.
For current SDK and its usage, please see information at [Other resources](#other-resources) below.

## About this project
This project uses Android [MediaProjection](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/projection/MediaProjection.html) (available from API level 21 onwards) to capture screenshots, which are sent to a remote Peer using the SkylinkConnection.[sendData](https://cdn.temasys.com.sg/skylink/skylinksdk/android/latest/doc/reference/sg/com/temasys/skylink/sdk/rtc/SkylinkConnection.html#sendData%28java.lang.String,%20byte[]%29) method.
The remote Peer receives each screenshot and render it in an ImageView.

The screensharing effect achieved here is a demonstration of a possible use case of SkylinkConnection.sendData, and is not compatible with the screensharing functionality on other Skylink SDKs, including the Skylink JS SDK's [shareScreen](https://cdn.temasys.com.sg/skylink/skylinkjs/latest/doc/classes/Skylink.html#method_shareScreen).

## Pre-requisites
